"""Cache-bypassing access to Signaloid C0 device nodes.

The C0 compute module device family exposes a register/MMIO interface layered
on top of the standard block-device protocol. Every read must reflect the
device's live state and every write must reach the hardware promptly, so the
operating system's buffer/page cache must never sit between the application and
the device and serve stale data.

This module delivers that guarantee behind a single ``read``/``write`` API. In
most cases you only need :class:`UnifiedBlockDevice`, which inspects the given
path and automatically selects the right strategy for the current platform and
node type. The concrete device classes are also exported for the rare case
where you already know exactly which one you need.

All device classes are safe to share between threads of a single process: each
instance serialises its own reads and writes. This does not coordinate access
between separate processes opening the same device -- that remains the caller's
responsibility.
